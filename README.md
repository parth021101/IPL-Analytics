# Comprehensive IPL Analytics & Prediction Platform

## Project Overview

This project is a full-stack platform designed for in-depth analysis and real-time prediction of Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket matches. It combines interactive data visualization, machine learning models, and a responsive web application to provide comprehensive insights and forecasting capabilities for cricket enthusiasts and strategists.

## Features

* **Full-Stack Architecture:** Demonstrates the integration of data processing, machine learning, and web development components.
* **Dynamic Power BI Dashboard:** Features interactive dashboards for comprehensive season-wise and team-wise player performance analysis, utilizing advanced DAX and visualization techniques.
* **Responsive Web Application:** Developed with **Flask** and **Streamlit**, enabling users to perform real-time match outcome predictions and head-to-head team analysis through a user-friendly interface.
* **Machine Learning Integration:** Incorporates a robust **GBoost model**, trained on historical IPL data (player stats, venues, match results), to predict match outcomes with high accuracy (achieving >85%).
* **Automated Data Processing:** Utilizes **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** to automate data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering, ensuring efficient and scalable data handling.
* **Actionable Insights:** Provides data-driven insights for player selection, strategic planning, and enhances fan engagement by making complex analytics accessible.

## Technologies Used

* **Backend & Web Frameworks:** Python (Flask, Streamlit)
* **Machine Learning:** GBoost (via Scikit-learn), Pandas, NumPy
* **Databases:** SQL (MySQL)
* **Business Intelligence:** Power BI (with DAX)
* **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
* **Development Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Google Collab

## Getting Started (Local Setup)

To get a local copy of this project running on your machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* pip (Python package installer)
* MySQL Server (and MySQL Workbench or a similar client for database management)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/ipl-analytics-platform.git](https://github.com/your-username/ipl-analytics-platform.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ipl-analytics-platform
    ```
3.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
4.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(You'll need to create a `requirements.txt` file in your repository. You can generate it by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing all your project's dependencies locally).*

### Database Setup

1.  **Start your MySQL Server.**
2.  **Create a database** for the project (e.g., `ipl_data`).
3.  **Import your historical IPL data** into this database. (If you have SQL dump files or scripts in your repo, mention them here, e.g., "Run `source database_schema.sql` and `source ipl_data.sql` in your MySQL client.")
4.  **Update database connection details** in your application's configuration file (e.g., `config.py` or similar).

### Running the Application

* **For the Flask Application (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    (Or whatever your main Flask entry point is)

* **For the Streamlit Application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    (Or whatever your main Streamlit entry point is)

Follow the on-screen instructions in your terminal, and the application should open in your web browser.
